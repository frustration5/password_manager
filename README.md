Welcome to Shloker

<p>
Here I will describe the functionality and planned future features of the Shloker application, a simple password manager.
</p>
<p>The obvious features like generating a password and saving entries per URL exist in this application
though are limited in certain ways. The initial version only generates a password of 16 characters
containing at least 1 of each:</p>
<p>
<li>lower case character (abc...)</li>
<li>upper case (ABC...)</li>
<li>number (123...)</li>
</p>
