# Welcome to Shloker

Here I will describe the functionality and planned future features of the Shloker application, a simple password manager.

The obvious features like generating a password and saving entries per URL exist in this application
though are limited in certain ways. The initial version only generates a password of 16 characters
containing at least 1 of each:

* lower case character (abc...)
* upper case (ABC...)
* number (123...)
